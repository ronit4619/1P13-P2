# 1P13-Project2
Project 2 for Integrated Cornerstone Design Projects in Engineering (1P13)

# Basic Goal
The coding aspect of Project 2 involved controlling a mechanical arm to pick up and drop objects of different sizes at different locations. 

# Description

Our groupâ€™s primary focus for several weeks has been to create a container to safely transfer surgical tools into autoclave bins with the use of a programmable Q-arm that functions based on muscle-sensor input. Two different sub-teams were required to complete different tasks for this assignment. The computing sub-team used python to create a program to control the Q-arm. Both sub-teams together created fully functioning final products to fulfill primary and secondary functions. The proejct was completed through several milestone checkpoints to reach the final complete product.
